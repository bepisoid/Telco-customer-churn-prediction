    "| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\n",
    "|--------|-------|----------------|\n",
    "| **AUC** | 0.837 | Strong discriminatory power between churners and non-churners. |\n",
    "| **Recall** | 0.793 | Captures **79.3%** of all potential churners. |\n",
    "| **Precision** | 0.506 | ~50% of targeted customers are actual churners. |\n",

    "### Assumptions\n",
    "- **Customer Base:** 10,000 active users.\n",
    "- **Base Churn Rate:** 27% (approx. 2,700 at-risk customers).\n",
    "- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** $600.\n",
    "- **Retention Campaign Cost:** $50 per targeted customer (incentives/marketing).\n",
    "- **Retention Success Rate:** 50% (probability of saving a customer if targeted).\n",

    "### Projected P&L (Profit and Loss)\n",

    "1.  **Campaign Reach (Who we target):**\n",
    "    Based on the model's Precision (50.6%) and Recall (79.3%), to reach **2,141** true churners, we must target approximately **4,231** customers (including false positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Costs:**\n",
    "    *   Total Targeted Users × Cost per User\n",
    "    *   4,231 × $50 = **$211,550**\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Revenue Retained:**\n",
    "    *   True Churners Found × Success Rate × LTV\n",
    "    *   2,141 × 50% × $600 = **$642,300**\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Net Profit:**\n",
    "    *   $642,300 - $211,550 = **$430,750**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return on Investment (ROI)\n",
    "The model generates a projected **203% ROI** on the retention budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "> By proactively targeting the top 42% most risky customers identified by the model, the company can save over **$430k annually** compared to a reactive approach."
